## hostnames-to-ipaddress.py

Python script that takes either a single domain or a list of domains and outputs to the screen.  There is a little
ASCII art and some try/except things so a little bit of everything for a beginner which is me.

## ipaddress-to-hostname.py

Python script that does the reverse of hostnames-to-ipaddress.py by taking a list of IP addresses
and trying to do a reverse lookup to pull a domain name.

## hostnames.txt

Just a list of hostnames for testing.

## ipaddresses.txt

Just a list of ip addresses for testing.
